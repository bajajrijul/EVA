## What are Channels and Kernels (according to EVA)?
Channels are the feature maps generated when the Kernels convolve over the images. Except the input image we can generate as many channels we want and the number is decided by the number of Kernels doing the convolution operation.
Kernels, Filters, Feature Extracters and 3X3 matrix, all of them are the same. Kernels are use to extract the important features from the images. During the first forward pass kernels are intitialized to get the best possible start and then on the value of numbers in the kernels is taken care by the back-propagation.

## Why should we only (well mostly) use 3x3 Kernels?
3X3 kernels are the most popular and widely used kernels because they have the line of symmetry in them which is necessary to extract all possible features from an image. But, what about other odd number kernels like 5X5 or 7X7, they also have the line of symmetry in them, yes, but after understanding the concept of receptive field researchers realized that what they can achieve from 5X5, 7X7 or 11X11, same can be achieved by using multiple 3X3 size kernels and impact that will be computational efficiency because multiple 3X3 size kernels will have less number of parameters than other odd kernels.

So, this boosted the use of 3X3 kernels and to support the cause further companies like nVidea they made changes in their hardware to support the use of 3X3 futher.
